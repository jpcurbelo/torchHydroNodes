Configuration Arguments
=======================

This page provides a list of possible configuration arguments.
Check out the files:
-  `docs/source/tutorials/run_concept_model/config_run_concept.yml <https://github.com/jpcurbelo/torchHydroNodes/blob/master/docs/source/tutorials/run_concept_model/config_run_concept.yml>`__ 
-  `docs/source/tutorials/run_concept_model/config_run_concept.yml <https://github.com/jpcurbelo/torchHydroNodes/blob/master/docs/source/tutorials/run_hybrid_model/config_run_hybrid_mlp.yml>`__ 

for examples of how a config file could look like.


## Data (download, location, and file configuration)

## Configuration Arguments

### Data entries

- ```dataset```: Defines which dataset will be used. Currently supported is ```camelsus``` (CAMELS-US dataset by [Newman et al., 2015](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/19/209/2015/)). The code is intended to support other datasets but might require specific adaptations, such as extending the parent class to handle differences in dataset structure or features.

- ```concept_data_dir```: Specifies the path to the data source required for the conceptual model. This path should be defined in the configuration file ```src/utils/data_dir.yml```.

- ```forcings```: This entry can be ignored if the dataset is not ```camelsus``` or unless it is strictly required by a newly defined dataset. It can be either a string or a list of strings corresponding to forcing products in the CAMELS dataset. 

    *Examples*:  ```[daymet, maurer, maurer_extended, nldas]```.

### Conceptual model entries

- ```concept_model```: Specifies the conceptual model to use. Supported models include ```exphydro```. The code is intended to support other conceptual models but might require specific adaptations, such as extending the parent class to accommodate the specifics of a newly defined model.

  ```exphydro```: A two-bucket model (water and snow) with 5 processes and 6 parameters. Reference: [HÃ¶ge et al., 2022.](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/5085/2022/)

### Neural network entries

### Hybrid model entries

### General experiment entries

- ```basin_file```: Specifies the full or relative path to a text file containing the basin IDs used for training, validation, and testing. Each line in the file should contain a single basin ID, as defined in the dataset.

- ```ode_solver_lib```: Specifies the library used for solving ODEs. Supported options include ```scipy``` and ```torchdiffeq```. 

  - **```scipy```**: Solves ODEs using ```solve_ivp``` from ```scipy.integrate```.  
    Reference: [SciPy Documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html).  
    Supported methods: ```RK45```, ```RK23```, ```DOP853```, ```Radau```, ```BDF```, ```LSODA```.  
    Example:
    - ```odesmethod```: ```RK23```  
    - For adaptive solvers:
      - ```rtol```: ```1e-4```  
      - ```atol```: ```1e-6```  

    **Note**: Methods such as ```euler``` and ```rk4``` are not part of the `scipy` module and have been separately implemented in the model class.  
    Example:
    - ```odesmethod```: ```euler```  
    - ```time_step```: ```0.5```  

  - **```torchdiffeq```**: Solves ODEs using the ```torchdiffeq``` library.  
    Reference: [TorchDiffEq Documentation](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq/blob/master/README.md).  
    Supported methods: ```bosh3```, ```rk4```, ```dopri5```, ```euler```, ```adaptive_heun```, ```midpoint```.  
    Example:
    - ```odesmethod```: ```bosh3```  
    - ```rtol```: ```1e-4```  
    - ```atol```: ```1e-6```

- **`train_start_date`**: Start date of the training period (first day of discharge) in the format `DD/MM/YYYY`.  
  Corresponding pairs of start and end dates denote the different periods.

- **`train_end_date`**: End date of the training period (last day of discharge) in the format `DD/MM/YYYY`.  

- **`valid_start_date`**: Start date of the validation period (first day of discharge) in the format `DD/MM/YYYY`.  

- **`valid_end_date`**: End date of the validation period (last day of discharge) in the format `DD/MM/YYYY`.  


### Metrics for Evaluation

- **`metrics`**: Specifies the list of metrics to calculate during validation and testing.  
  Available metrics include:
  - `NSE`
  - `Alpha-NSE`
  - `Beta-NSE`
  - `FHV`
  - `FMS`
  - `FLV`
  - `KGE`
  - `Beta-KGE`
  - `Peak-Timing`
  - `Peak-MAPE`
  - `Pearson-r`

- **`metrics`**: Specifies the list of metrics to calculate during validation (testing).  
  Available metrics include: `NSE`, `Alpha-NSE`, `Beta-NSE`, `FHV`, `FMS`, `FLV`, `KGE`, `Beta-KGE`, `Peak-Timing`, `Peak-MAPE`, `Pearson-r`.
